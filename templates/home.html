	      <h1>The Air Quality Initiative</h1>
		<p class="lead"> Why is this so important?</p>
		<p>
		  Human beings have begun to impact the environment we breathe in ways that 
		  are irreversible. 	  
		  <br/>
		  Environmental scientists conclude that there are some things that cannot be reversed with regards to the earth and its resources. And regrettably, the kind of global political will required to safeguard our future environment is all but acheived currently. 

		  Therefore, the problem of the common man: the city that promises work, a better living and well being, becomes a place which harbours the seeds of health complications. There are laws in many countries which stipulate that a city having a population of over a number of people is mandated by law to collect, collate and publish Air Quality Indicator (AQI) information for its vicinity. The US currently mandates every city with a population above 3.5 lakh people to make AQI data available. These laws uphold the moral right of the citizen who is desirous of inhabiting or visiting a place, to know what the invisible air contains and what it would mean to them. Those who are sensitive to the air or to environmental factors have a necessity to safguard their health and to be able to guage whether a given place would be safe for them to visit.
		  <br/>
		  It becomes resonably imperative for us to see the unseen and to enable others to see it as well.
		  <br/>
		  Keeping that in mind, we at IndiaSpend have created tools to analyse air quality patterns from a qualitative as well as quantitive standpoint. We hope that one can gain perspective as to where we stand with regards to the air we breathe.
